Savic 2008 first introduced the idea of transit compartments being a
mechanistic explanation of a a lag-time type phenomena. rxode2 has special handling of these models:

You can specify this in a similar manner as the original paper. Note
that we use `evid=7` instead of `evid=1` for these sorts of transit
compartment models. `evid=7` is the transit compartment model/phantom
event. This puts the dose in the `dose()` function and calculates time
since last dose `tad()` but doesnâ€™t actually put the dose in the
compartment. This allows the `transit()` function to easily apply to the
compartment.


```{r out.width="100%"}

library(rxode2)

mod <- function() {
  model({
    ## Table 3 from Savic 2007
    cl = 17.2 # (L/hr)
    vc = 45.1 # L
    ka = 0.38 # 1/hr
    mtt = 0.37 # hr
    bio=1
    n = 20.1
    k = cl/vc
    ktr = (n+1)/mtt
    ## note that lgammafn is the same as lgamma in R.
    d/dt(depot) = exp(log(bio*podo(depot))+log(ktr)+n*log(ktr*tad(depot))-
                        ktr*tad(depot)-lgammafn(n+1))-ka*depot
    d/dt(cen) = ka*depot-k*cen
  })
}

et <- et(0, 7, length.out=200) %>%
  et(amt=20, time=0, evid=7)

transit <- rxSolve(mod, et)

plot(transit, cen, ylab="Central Concentration")
```

Another option is to specify the transit compartment function
`transit` syntax.  This specifies the parameters `transit(number of
transit compartments, mean transit time, bioavailability)`.  The
bioavailability term is optional.

The same model can be specified by:

```{r}
mod <- function() {
  ini({
    ## Table 3 from Savic 2007
    cl  <- 17.2 # (L/hr)
    vc  <- 45.1 # L
    ka  <- 0.38 # 1/hr
    mtt <- 0.37 # hr
    bio <- 1
    n   <- 20.1
  })
  model({
    k           <- cl/vc
    ktr         <- (n+1)/mtt
    d/dt(depot) <- transit(n,mtt,bio)-ka*depot
    d/dt(cen)   <- ka*depot-k*cen
  })
}

et <- et(0, 7, length.out=200) %>%
  et(amt=20, evid=7)

transit <- rxSolve(mod, et)

plot(transit, cen, ylab="Central Concentration")
```

A couple of things to keep in mind when using this approach:

- This approach implicitly assumes that the absorption through the
  transit compartment is completed before the next dose begins

- Different types of doses (ie bolus/infusion) to the compartment
  affect the time after dose calculation (`tad`) which is used in the
  transit compartment calculation.  These (therefore) are not
  currently supported.  The most stable way is to use `tad(cmt)` and
  `podo(cmt)`, this way doses to other compartments do not affect the
  transit compartment calculation.

- Internally, the `transit` syntax uses either the currently defined
  cmt `d/dt(cmt)=transit(...)`, or `cmt`. If the transit compartment
  is used outside of a `d/dt()` (not recommended), the `cmt` that is
  used is the last `d/dt(cmt)` defined it the model. This also means
  compartments do not affect one another (ie a oral, transit
  compartment drug dosed immediately with an IV infusion)
