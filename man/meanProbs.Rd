\title{Calculate expected quantiles with normal or t sampling distribution}
\usage{
meanProbs(x, ...)

\method{meanProbs}{default}(
  x,
  probs = seq(0, 1, 0.25),
  na.rm = FALSE,
  names = TRUE,
  useT = TRUE,
  onlyProbs = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector whose mean and probability based confidence
values are wanted, NA and NaN values are not allowed in numeric
vectors unless ‘na.rm’ is ‘TRUE’.}

\item{probs}{numeric vector of probabilities with values in \link{0,1}.}

\item{na.rm}{logical; if true, any NA and NaN's are removed from
\code{x} before the quantiles are computed.}

\item{names}{logical; if true, the result has a names attribute.}

\item{useT}{logical; if true, use the t-distribution to calculate
the confidence-based estimates. If false use the normal
distribution to calculate the confidence based estimates.}

\item{onlyProbs}{logical; if true, only return the probability based
confidence interval estimates, otherwise return}
}
\value{
By default the return has the probabilities as names (if
named) with the points where the expected distribution are
located given the sampling mean and standard deviation. If
\code{onlyProbs=FALSE} then it would prepend mean, variance, standard
deviation, minimum, maximum and number of non-NA observations.
}
\description{
The generic function \code{meanProbs} produces expected quantiles under
either the t distribution or the normal sampling distribution. This
uses \code{qnorm()} or \code{qt()} with the mean and standard deviation.
}
\details{
For a single probability, p, it uses either:

mean + qt(p, df=n)*sd/sqrt(n)

or

mean + qnorm(p)*sd/sqrt(n)

The smallest observation corresponds to a probability of 0 and the
largest to a probability of 1 and the mean corresponds to 0.5.

The mean and standard deviation of the sample is calculated based
on Welford's method for a single pass.

This is meant to perform in the same way as \code{quantile()} so it can
be a drop in replacement for code using \code{quantile()} but using
distributional assumptions.
}
\examples{

quantile(x<- rnorm(1001))
meanProbs(x)

# Can get some extra statistics if you request onlyProbs=FALSE
meanProbs(x, onlyProbs=FALSE)

x[2] <- NA_real_

meanProbs(x, onlyProbs=FALSE)

quantile(x<- rnorm(42))

meanProbs(x)

meanProbs(x, useT=FALSE)
