\title{Log likelihood of T and it's derivatives (from stan)}
\usage{
llikT(x, df, mean = 0, sd = 1, full = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Observation}

\item{df}{degrees of freedom (\eqn{> 0}, maybe non-integer).  \code{df
      = Inf} is allowed.}

\item{mean}{Mean for the likelihood}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation for the likelihood}

\item{full}{Add the data frame showing x, mean, sd as well as the
fx and derivatives}
}
\value{
data frame with \code{fx} for the log pdf value of with \code{dDf}
\code{dMean} and \code{dSd} that has the derivatives with respect to the parameters at
the observation time-point
}
\description{
Log likelihood of T and it's derivatives (from stan)
}
\details{
In an \code{rxode2()} model, you can use \code{llikT()} but you have to
use all arguments.  You can also get the derivative of \code{df}, \code{mean} and \code{sd} with
\code{llikTDdf()}, \code{llikTDmean()} and \code{llikTDsd()}.

\examples{

\donttest{
x <- seq(-3, 3, length.out = 21)

llikT(x, 7, 0, 1)

llikT(x, 15, 0, 1, full=TRUE)

et <- et(-3, 3, length.out=10)
et$nu <- 7
et$mean <- 0
et$sd <- 1

model <- rxode2({
  fx <- llikT(time, nu, mean, sd)
  dDf <- llikTDdf(time, nu, mean, sd)
  dMean <- llikTDmean(time, nu, mean, sd)
  dSd   <- llikTDsd(time, nu, mean, sd)
})

rxSolve(model, et)
