\usage{
mix(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Arguments to the mixture model.

The first call to the mixture model function takes an odd number of
arguments (at least 3).

For example the model we could have:

cl = mix(cl1, p1, cl2, p2, cl3)

Here there is a mixture of three clearance variables, \code{cl1}, \code{cl2},
and \code{cl3}, at a probability of \code{p1}, \code{p2}, and the last one is
assumed to be \code{1 - p1 - p2}.

For simulations this is selected randomly.  For estimations this is
selected by the data for each individual.

After the first call when the number of populations has been
established, you can also call the mixture model with the number of
populations, for example:

v = mix(v1, v2, v3)

The ui function will translate this to the following model:

v = mix(v1, p1, v2, p2, v3)

This is because the first call to \code{mix()} sets the probabilities.
In rxode2/nlmixr2 these probabilities should be conserved between
the models.  These probabilities also have to be defined in the ini
block directly.}
